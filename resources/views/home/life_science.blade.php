                        <p>Medical device companies develop and manufacture medical and surgical instruments that can be
                            used to diagnose, prevent, monitor, and treat medical conditions. A medical device can be an

                        <p>The complex unmet patient needs drive the growth of the medical device industry. In the year
                            2019, the global medical devices market was worth nearly $456.9bn, with top medical device
                            companies Medtronic, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Johnson & Johnson, Abbott and GE Healthcare
                            contributing mainly with the release of new technologies. The leading tech giants such as
                            Google and Apple have started making big strides in this area. The tech giants are
                            leveraging their core strengths to develop 'Software as a Medical Device'.</p>

                        <p>Contract research organisations (CROs) or contract manufacturing organisations (CMOs),
                            sometimes called Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (CDMOs), play a
                            critical role in supporting the pharmaceutical, biotech and medical devices industries.

                        </p>
                        <p>CROs and CMOs support clientsâ€™ efforts to research, test, refine, manufacture and market
                            drugs, drug products and medical devices.

                            The contract research organisations (CRO) business value was estimated at $35.1bn in 2018
                            and is expected to reach $50.7bn by 2025.

                            The top CRO companies such as Covance, Parexel, Icon and IQVIA are extending companies'
                            capabilities and global reach through mergers and acquisitions, making the CRO marketplace
                            increasingly competitive.</p>
